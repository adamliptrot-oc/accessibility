## Accessibility audit

The accessibility of your service is your team’s responsibility.

### Before you request your audit

Before you request an in-house accessibility audit, there are some basic targets that we’d like you to hit. Meeting these targets before your request will save us all some time, meaning you’ll get your audit back sooner. If you think you need help with this, [check your service’s accessibility before you get a review](https://github.com/hmrc/accessibility/blob/master/docs/check-your-services-accessibility-before-you-get-a-review.md).

✅ **Please tick the boxes below to show you’ve read the requirements.**

Before raising this request for an in-house accessibility audit, we did the following things as a team:

- [ ] Made sure each page of our service contains valid HTML.
- [ ] Made sure each page of our service is free from WCAG errors.
- [ ] Tested each page of our service with at least one screen reader, to make sure it was usable.

### After you request your audit

Once your Issue is raised, you’ll be able to track its progress on our [In-house Audits](https://github.com/hmrc/accessibility/projects/1) board. You’ll also be able to see how many other audits we may have in the queue before it, so please be patient.
