# Stage three: Continuous Integration tools

Once your service is deployed to staging you’ll want to be running tests against it. We have the following available which you can use.

## Accessibility testing library

> “This library can be used to integrate a number of automated tools into Selenium UI test repositories to help identify a number of potential accessibility issues in web front-ends.”

Available at [hmrc/accessibility-testing-library](https://github.com/hmrc/accessibility-testing-library).

## Accessibility assessment

> “This project contains the `Dockerfile` and images assets required to create the `accessibility-assessment` image that is used in CI for the assessment of captured pages using `axe`, `pa11y` and `vnu`. The violations found during the assessment are pushed to ELK.”
